Time Series Analysis for Store Sales Forecasting

This project analyzes historical sales data from a retail store to forecast future demand for a specific product. Using stationarity testing, autocorrelation analysis, and seasonal decomposition, the project evaluates temporal patterns in sales. An ARIMA model is then applied to predict future sales, assessing model performance with RMSE for accuracy insights.
